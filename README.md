Create users and microposts with this high-level Rails application focusing on: MVC, REST architecture, and data modeling. Complete with a [live, database-backed web application in production](https://nameless-journey-89117.herokuapp.com/).

/users


/microposts


Project outcomes:

  * Scaffolding automatically creates code to model data and interact with it through the web
  * Uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for structuring web applications.
  * As interpreted by Rails, the REST architecture includes a standard set of URLs and controller actions for interacting with data models
  * Supports data validations to place constraints on the values of data model attributes
  * Built-in functions for defining associations between different data models
